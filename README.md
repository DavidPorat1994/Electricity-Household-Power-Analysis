Electricity Consumption Analysis in an Israeli Household

**Project Overview**
This project analyzes electricity consumption in a household of four: two adults and two children, located in Israel.
--one adult at home??
The primary objective is to understand the patterns of energy usage,
identify potential areas for efficiency improvements, and provide insights that could help in reducing overall electricity consumption.

**Dataset**
Description
Time Period: The dataset covers electricity consumption over a specified time period (e.g., 1 year, 6 months).
Frequency: Hourly/Daily/Monthly electricity usage data.

Columns:
Timestamp: Date and time of the recorded consumption.
Electricity_Consumption_kWh: The amount of electricity consumed in kilowatt-hours.
Temperature: External temperature readings (if applicable).
Appliance_Usage: Information on the usage of major appliances (if tracked).
Family_Activity: Notes on family activities or routines that may influence consumption (optional).

Data Source
The data was collected using smart meters installed in the household, provided by Israel **Electric Corporation**.

**Analysis**
Goals
Consumption Patterns: Analyze daily, weekly, and monthly electricity consumption patterns.
Peak Usage Times: Identify peak consumption periods and correlate them with household activities or external factors (e.g., temperature).
Comparison: Compare electricity consumption on weekdays versus weekends.
Efficiency Recommendations: Based on the analysis, suggest methods to optimize electricity use and reduce costs.
Methodology
Data Cleaning: Handle any missing or inconsistent data, format timestamps, and ensure all units are consistent.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data to identify trends and patterns.
Feature Engineering: Create new features like average daily consumption, peak hour usage, etc.
Modeling (optional): Use predictive modeling to forecast future consumption or simulate the impact of changes in behavior.
Reporting: Compile findings into a comprehensive report with visualizations and actionable insights.
Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python/R
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (for modeling)
Data Visualization: Power BI/Tableau/Matplotlib
Database: SQL Server (if applicable)
